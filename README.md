# LangChainMastery 

Welcome to **LangChain Mastery** – a curated, hands-on repository to help you learn LangChain from scratch to advanced use cases. Whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your understanding of advanced LLM workflows, this repo provides structured examples, explanations, and projects to guide your journey.

## What is LangChain?

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides tools to chain together components like models, memory, agents, tools, and data sources into powerful AI-driven applications.

## 📘 Fundamental Concepts

Start your LangChain journey with these foundational topics, designed to help you understand core concepts through hands-on examples.

# ⚙️ LangChain Components

LangChain is modular by design. These components can be combined in different ways to build sophisticated LLM-powered workflows. Here's a breakdown of the key components you'll explore:

1. LLMs (Large Language Models)

   Integrate models like OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, and others.

Project Title:
Text Summarization Assistant

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent assistant capable of generating concise and informative summaries from longer bodies of text. The assistant will support extractive and abstractive summarization techniques and be designed to help project managers quickly digest reports, meeting transcripts, documentation, and other text-heavy resources.

Key Features:

Input Processing: Accepts plain text or documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.) as input.

Summarization Modes:

Extractive Summarization – selects key sentences from the source text.

Abstractive Summarization – generates novel sentences that convey the essence of the original content.

Customizable Summary Length: Users can set the desired length (short, medium, long).

Domain Adaptation: Tailors summaries based on the domain (e.g., technical, business, medical).

Multi-language Support: Optional feature for multilingual input and output.

Technologies & Tools:

Python

Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., BART, T5)

PyTorch or TensorFlow

Streamlit or Flask for frontend (if needed)

spaCy or NLTK for preprocessing

Docker for containerization (optional)

Git for version control

Deliverables:

Trained summarization models

Evaluation reports (ROUGE, BLEU scores, etc.)

Simple UI for testing (if applicable)

Documentation and deployment guide

Timeline:

Week 1–2: Data collection and preprocessing

Week 3–4: Model training and fine-tuning

Week 5: Evaluation and optimization

Week 6: Interface development and deployment

Target Users:
Project managers, analysts, and professionals who need quick insights from large volumes of text.

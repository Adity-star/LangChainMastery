        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we dive into **Few-Shot Prompting**, a powerful technique that allows language models to generate high-quality outputs with minimal fine-tuning. By providing carefully selected examples, Few-Shot Prompting ensures precise and context-aware responses across a variety of use cases.\n",
        "## What is Few-Shot Prompting?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Few-Shot Prompting** is a technique that guides language models to generate high-quality responses by providing a small number of carefully chosen examples. Unlike traditional methods, which may require extensive fine-tuning, few-shot prompting leverages the model’s inherent ability to generalize from examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts:\n",
        "- **Example-Driven**: Few-shot prompting relies on providing a few relevant examples within the prompt.\n",
        "- **Context-Aware**: The provided examples help the model understand the desired context, making it more likely to generate accurate and context-sensitive outputs.\n",
        "- **Reduced Fine-Tuning**: This approach minimizes the need for expensive and time-consuming fine-tuning of the model.\n"

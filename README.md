# LangChainMastery 

Welcome to **LangChain Mastery** – a curated, hands-on repository to help you learn LangChain from scratch to advanced use cases. Whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your understanding of advanced LLM workflows, this repo provides structured examples, explanations, and projects to guide your journey.

## What is LangChain?

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides tools to chain together components like models, memory, agents, tools, and data sources into powerful AI-driven applications.

## 📘 Fundamental Concepts

Start your LangChain journey with these foundational topics, designed to help you understand core concepts through hands-on examples.

1. 📖 [**Intro to LangChain**](https://github.com/Adity-star/LangChainMastery/tree/main/Modules/01_Intro)  
   A beginner-friendly introduction explaining:
   - What LangChain is  
   - Why it’s useful for building with LLMs  
   - How to set up and run your first LangChain application

> 🤖 **Build Your First Chatbot**  
>  - LangChain + HuggingFace to build a basic conversational agent. 
>  - Basic logic to handle input and LLM response.

2. [Models](https://github.com/Adity-star/LangChainMastery/tree/main/Modules/02_models)

Learn how to connect LangChain with popular model providers and use different types of models in your applications:

#### 🔤 LLMs (Large Language Models)
Use text generation models to complete tasks like answering questions, summarizing, or generating content.
- Providers: OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, and more  
- Learn how to integrate and configure these models in LangChain

> 🔗 **Simple LLM with OpenAI**  
> A practical example showing how to use OpenAI's models with LangChain.  
> 📄 [View Code: `llm_model.py`](https://github.com/Adity-star/LangChainMastery/blob/main/02_LLMs/llm_model.py)


#### 💬 [Chat Models](https://github.com/Adity-star/LangChainMastery/tree/main/Modules/02_models/ChatModels)
Designed for conversational use cases (like ChatGPT), these models allow message-based interactions.
- Handle structured dialogues with roles (`user`, `assistant`, etc.)
- Use tools like `ChatOpenAI` for better control and reliability


#### 🧠 [Embedding Models](https://github.com/Adity-star/LangChainMastery/tree/main/Modules/02_models/EmbeddingModels)
Convert text into high-dimensional vectors for tasks like:
- Semantic search
- Similarity comparison
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

> 🔍 Power your retrievers with vector embeddings for smarter, context-aware applications.

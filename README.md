# LangChainMastery 

Welcome to **LangChain Mastery** – a curated, hands-on repository to help you learn LangChain from scratch to advanced use cases. Whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your understanding of advanced LLM workflows, this repo provides structured examples, explanations, and projects to guide your journey.

## What is LangChain?

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides tools to chain together components like models, memory, agents, tools, and data sources into powerful AI-driven applications.

1. LLMs (Large Language Models)

   Integrate models like OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, and others.

    🔗 [Simple LLms Using OpenAI](https://github.com/Adity-star/LangChainMastery/tree/main/LLMs)

Prompts
Templates to guide model outputs. Create reusable and dynamic prompt templates.
🔗 Prompt Templates in Action

Chains
Chain together multiple components (e.g., LLM calls, tools, memory) into workflows.
🔗 Simple and Sequential Chains

Memory
Add state to your applications so they can remember past interactions.
🔗 Implementing Memory

Agents
Enable dynamic decision-making. Agents choose which actions to take based on user input.
🔗 LangChain Agents Example

Tools
Extend agents with capabilities like search, calculations, and API calls.
🔗 Using Tools with Agents

Retrievers and Vector Stores
Retrieve relevant documents from large datasets using embeddings.
🔗 Vector Search with FAISS
